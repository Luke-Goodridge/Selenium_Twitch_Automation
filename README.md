# Twitch Web Automation in selenium

Just a small side project i'm working on using Python and Selenium. It;s in its simplist form at the moment but i hope to expand it out to test more features.

# What it does

Currently the functionality uses both the chrome web driver and the firefox web driver to test all directory buttons on the twitch.tv website.

It checks for any failed routes e.g clicking the gaming button didnt take me to the gaming page. It also makes sure all the buttons are present.

I have also formatted the output to be user friendly to testers using it.

It prints out the following at run time.
